    Remove use of Socket::GetAddrInfo.

    Socket 2.001 (and possibly earlier) expose getaddrinfo() so we don't
    need Socket::GetAddrInfo anymore. Also, the author of that module
    suggests that it's obsolete since Socket provides it now.

    Fix usage of Socket::GetAddrInfo for new version 0.22.

    avenj on irc.perl.org #poe pointed out that Socket::GetAddrInfo 0.22
    changed public behavior and began throwing the following error. This
    change compensates for that and requires version 0.22 or later.

    :newapi tag is no longer supported by Socket::GetAddrInfo; just 'use'
    it directly

    Fix address untainting error.

    Reported by Alberto Sim√µes on irc.perl.org and diagnosted with
    copious help from Chris Williams. Thanks, guys!

    [rt.cpan.org 76987] Add a cancel() method to stop pending requests.

    Modified resolve() to return a request ID. Added cancel(), which
    accepts a request ID and cancels it.
    POE::Component::Client::Keepalive requires it.

    [rt.cpan.org 76550] Avoid hang when no requests made.

    Fixed thanks to Sergei Kozunov's bug report and test case. A sidecar
    process was created at startup, but no idle timeout was set. These
    timeouts are only set when requests happen, and in an application
    where all addresses are already resolved, no timeout is set. So the
    component lingers forever.

    [rt.cpan.org 76549] Fix a little typo in sidecar cleanup.

    _poe_sidecar_closed() was destroying the wrong sidecar process. Thank
    you, Kozunov, for the code review and bug report. Two little octets
    can make a huge difference.

    [rt.cpan.org 76314] Untaint addresses before Socket::GetAddrInfo.

    Dylan Doxey pointed out that Socket::GetAddrInfo rejects tainted
    addresses. Untaint them first, per his recommendation and test case.

    [rt.cpan.org 67601] Test IPv6 availability against non-localhost.

    Larwan Burke pointed out that localhost is a bad name to resolve when
    testing for IPv6 availability. It tends to be in /etc/hosts, which
    resolves whether or not the named can.

    [rt.cpan.org 74486] Fix a typo in a hash key.

    I hate hash-based data structures for just this reason: typos are
    silently ignored. Many thanks to Jon Portnoy for reporting this one.

    Add an environment variable to override the default IP version
    preference.

    As IPv6 is adopted, more and more places will behave differently than
    expected. The POCO_RESOLVER_IPV environment variable gives users a
    way to override the legacy behavior during this potentially painful
    transition.

    Resolve a runaway fork when running in EmbedPerl.

    Sjors Gielen reported a runaway fork in irc.perl.org #poe. $^X is not
    always a path to the perl binary. Resolved by using Configure's
    notion of perlpath and _exe, per Sjors' recommendation and discussion
    of $^X in perlvar.

    Allow developers to use sidecar-based modules with PAR and other
    packagers.

    Applied a modified versin of a patch from Markus Jansen at Ericsson.
    It adds a parameter to POE::Component::Resolver so the developer can
    point to a custom sidecar program. That program can be bundld in PAR
    using special techniques. Thanks also go to Steffen Mueller and
    Roderich Schupp, who helped design the patch.

    Use port 80 rather than string "http" on Solaris.

    Chris Williams discovered tests would fail on Solaris with "service
    name not available for the specified socket type". It turns out they
    don't list "http" in /etc/services.

    Load the POE::Component::Resolver::Sidecar class.

    The presence of this module is requested on MSWin32. Resolves
    rt.cpan.org ticket 69172, reported by Gabor Szabo.
