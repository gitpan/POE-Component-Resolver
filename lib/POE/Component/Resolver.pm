	POE::Kernel->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::Resolver performs Socket::GetAddrInfo::getaddrinfo()
calls in subprocesses where they're permitted to block as long as
necessary.

By default it will run eight subprocesses and prefer address families
in whatever order Socket::GetAddrInfo returns them.  These defaults
can be overridden with constructor parameters.

=head2 PUBLIC METHODS

=head3 new

Create a new resolver.  Returns an object that must be held and used
to make requests.  See the synopsis.

Accepts up to two optional named parameters.

"af_order" may contain an arrayref with the address families to
permit, in the order in which they're preferred.  Without "af_order",
the component will return addresses in the order in which
Socket::GetAddrInfo provides them.

	# Prefer IPv6 addresses, but also return IPv4 ones.
	my $r1 = POE::Component::Resolver->new(
		af_order => [ AF_INET6, AF_INET ]
	);

	# Only return AF_INET6 addresses.
	my $r2 = POE::Component::Resolver->new(
		af_order => [ AF_INET6 ]
	);

"max_resolvers" controls the component's parallelism by defining the
maximum number of sidecar processes to manage.  It defaults to 8, but
fewer or more processes can be configured depending on usage
requirements.

	# One at a time, but without the pesky blocking.
	my $r3 = POE::Component::Resolver->new( max_resolvers => 1 );

=head3 resolve

resolve() begins a new request to resolve a domain.  The request will
be enqueued in the component until a sidecar process can service it.
Resolve requires two parameters and accepts some additional optional
ones.

"host" and "service" are required and contain the host (name or
Internet address) and service (name or numeric port) that will be
passed verbatim to getaddrinfo().  See L<Socket::GetAddrInfo> for
details.

"event" is optional; it contains the name of the event that will
contain the resolver response.  If omitted, it will default to
"resolver_response"; you may want to specify a shorter event name.

"hints" is optional.  If specified, it must contain a hashref of hints
exactly as getaddrinfo() expects them.  See L<Socket::GetAddrInfo> for
details.

"misc" is optional continuation data that will be passed back in the
response.  It may contain any type of data the application requires.

=head3 unpack_addr

In scalar context, unpack_addr($response_addr_hashref) returns the
addr element of $response_addr_hashref in a numeric form appropriate
for the address family of the address.

	sub handle_resolver_response {
		my ($error, $addresses, $request) = @_[ARG0..ARG2];

		foreach my $a (@$addresses) {
			my $numeric_addr = $resolver->unpack_addr($a);
			print "$request->{host} = $numeric_addr\n";
		}
	}

In list context, it returns the numeric port and address.

	sub handle_resolver_response {
		my ($error, $addresses, $request) = @_[ARG0..ARG2];

		foreach my $a (@$addresses) {
			my ($$numeric_addr, $port) = $resolver->unpack_addr($a);
			print "$request->{host} = $numeric_addr\n";
		}
	}

unpack_addr() is a convenience wrapper around getnameinfo() from
Socket::GetAddrInfo.  You're certainly welcome to use the discrete
function instead.

unpack_addr() returns bleak emptiness on failure, regardless of
context.  You can check for undef return.

=head3 DESTROY

This component is shut down when it's destroyed, following Perl's
rules for object destruction.  Any pending requests are canceled, and
their responses will be errors.

=head2 PUBLIC EVENTS

=head3 resolver_response

The resolver response event includes three parameters.

$_[ARG0] and $_[ARG1] contain the retrn values from
Socket::GetAddrInfo's getaddrinfo() call.  These are an error message
(if the call failed), and an arrayref of address structures if the
call succeeded.

The component provides its own error message, 'component shut down'.
This response is given for every pending request at the time the user
shuts down the component.

$_[ARG2] contains a hashref of information provided to the resolve()
method.  Specifically, the values of resolve()'s "host", "service" and
"misc" parameters.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

=head2 Microsoft Windows

This module requires "Microsoft TCP/IP version 6" to be installed.
Steps for Windows XP Pro (the steps for your particular version of
Windows may be subtly or drastically different):

=over

=item * Open your Control Panel

=item * Open your Network Connections

=item * Select your network connection from the available one(s)

=item * In the Local Area Connection Status dialog, click the Properties button

=item * If "Microsoft TCP/IP version 6" is listed as an item being used, you are done.

=item * Otherwise click Install...

=item * Choose to add a Protocol

=item * And install "Microsoft TCP/IP version 6" from the list of network protocols.

=back

=head1 BUGS

There is no timeout on requests.

There is no way to cancel a pending request.
